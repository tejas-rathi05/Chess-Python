# Python CHESS
This project is a GUI-based chess game developed entirely in Python. It features an interactive graphical interface where users can play chess against each other locally. The game board and pieces are displayed using Python's Pygame library, which allows for smooth graphics and easy user interactions. Future updates will include the addition of an AI opponent to play against, enhancing the gameplay experience.<br>
